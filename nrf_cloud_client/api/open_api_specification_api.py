    nRF Cloud REST API

    # Overview   The [nRF Cloud REST API](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-cloud/page/APIs/REST/RESTOverview.html)   allows you to programmatically interact with, and retrieve historical information generated by, any device that you have   connected to <a href='https://nrfcloud.com'>nRFCloud.com</a>. This includes both IP-based devices–that is, devices that have an IP address and can talk directly to our   IoT platform–and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, which require the use of an IP-based device (a gateway).  The REST API documentation is a supplement to the <a href='https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-cloud/page/index.html'>main nRF Cloud documentation</a>.  [DevZone](https://devzone.nordicsemi.com) is Nordic Semiconductor's official tech support site and community. Get help from a dedicated tech support team and more than 25,000 other community members.  If you are encountering unexpected behavior or errors, check the current [status](https://status.nrfcloud.com) of nRF Cloud.  # Error Codes Some of the endpoints return specific error codes (called 'nRF Codes'), which can be found in this table.   <table>       <thead>       <tr>           <th style='width:10%'>nRF&nbsp;Code</th>           <th style='width:20%'>Error</th>           <th style='width:35%'>Reason</th>           <th style='width:35%'>Solution</th>       </tr>       </thead>       <tbody>       <tr>           <td valign='top'>               <div data-section-id='section/Error-Codes/40000'>40000</div>           </td>           <td valign='top'>Bad request error.</td>           <td valign='top'>This error could mean many things.
